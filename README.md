# openforge-assessment-hscheuerle
48 hour assessment for OpenForge. Demonstrates angular, ngrx, and ionic proficiency.

## usage
because github api is no longer fully accessable without some authentication, to run this app in development, you need to create and place an access token in the project.

1. create the file ./env.ts in the project root
2. add the following line and save

<pre><code>export const DEV_TOKEN = 'your_token_here';</code></pre>
